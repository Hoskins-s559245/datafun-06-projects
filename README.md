## Description

### Hoskins_Task_1_Task_3_Task5.ipynb Consists of all the requirements outlined in the three tasks of the project assignment

<br />Task 1 Requirements:
1. Use Statistics mean, median, mode, std dev, variance
2. built-in functions min, max, len, count of records, number of columns
3. Get Data into a list
4. Use filter, map and list comprehensions to clean and transform data
5. use pandas
6. use matplotlib
7. Strive to tell a story

<br />Task 3 Requirements:
1. Use everything you've learned to conduct a unique data exploration project using some information related to your domain. 
2. Tell a story with data (do a web search to learn more).
3. Use this project to feature all of the key skills learned - creating a professional notebook, writing a good README.md (do a web search). 
4. Include challenging Python programming aspects - find a reason to use filter(), map(), and list comprehensions.
5. Have fun and make it unique.

<br />Optional Task 5. Bonus
1. As part of your second project, include a new library or module we won't have time to explore. 
2. Consider imageio, nltk, texatistic, textblob, wordcloud, or others. 
3. Basically, look for something that might interest you and see if you can learn it on your own and apply it to your domain/project. 
4. Clearly label your project as the bonus and explain your data question, your module, and your results. 

### Hoskins_Task2.ipynb consists of all the requirements outlined in Task 2 of the project assignment
<br />Task 2 Requirements: 
1. Follow the instructions for Exercise 9.16 (starting pg. 350).
2. Complete the exercise in a notebook. 
3. 1-Load: Get the file, store it in your repo, and load it into a DataFrame. 
4. 2-View: Display the first 7 rows and the last 7 rows.
5. 3-Describe: Use the DataFrame describe() function to calculate basic descriptive statistics for all numeric columns. 
6. 4-Series: Use the Series method describe() to calculate the descriptive stats for all category/text columns.
7. 5-Unique: Use the Series method unique() to get unique category values. 
6. 6Histograms: Use the DataFrame's hist() function to create a histogram for each numerical column.
7. Required: Use Section headings in your Markdown to make it clear that each of these sections are shown in your notebook. They should be numbered 1-5 and include the keyword shown above.
8. Required: Include the title of the notebook, and your name and date at the top.
9. Do these consistently. A heading and section titles is required in every notebook.
